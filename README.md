# Bio-Inspired-Computation_algorithms
## Developing different types of bio-inspired computation algorithms from scratch.

The project contains writing different types of bio-inspired computation algorithms such as Genetic, Memetic, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony, Particle Swarm Optimization and Self-organizing map to solve famous problems like TSP and etc.
